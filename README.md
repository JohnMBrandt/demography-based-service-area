# public-resource-mapper

## Current Abilities
This web-mapping application allows users to:

* set the map-view to their current location
* generate a route between any two points
  
## Planned Future Abilities

* include public resource locations (WIC, after-school programs, mental-health centers, planned parenthood, abortion clinics)
* Create a navigation bar for users to change elements of the map
* Provide links upon route creation to a google maps route that the user could then transfer to their phone
